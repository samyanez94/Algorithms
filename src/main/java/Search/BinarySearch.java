 * Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted

 * unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the
 * remaining half until it is successful.
 *
 * Average case = O(log n) Worst case = O(log n) Best case = O(1)
