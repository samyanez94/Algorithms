package Sort;

/**
 * The algorithm that people often use to sort bridge hands is to consider the cards one at a time,
 * inserting each into its proper place among those already considered. In insertion sort the items
 * to the left of the current index are in sorted order during the sort, but they are not in their
 * final position, as they may have to be moved to make room for smaller items encountered later.
 * The array is, however, fully sorted when the index reaches the right end.
 *
 * Average case = O(n^2) Worst case = O(n^2) Best case = O(n)
